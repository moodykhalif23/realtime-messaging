```

### Running the Application

1. **Start MongoDB:**
```bash
# On macOS with Homebrew
brew services start mongodb-community

# On Ubuntu/Debian
sudo systemctl start mongod

# On Windows, start MongoDB service from Services panel
```

2. **Start RabbitMQ:**
```bash
# On macOS with Homebrew
brew services start rabbitmq

# On Ubuntu/Debian
sudo systemctl start rabbitmq-server

# On Windows, start RabbitMQ service from Services panel
```

3. **Start the application:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. **Access the application:**
- Main interface: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- API documentation: [http://localhost:3000/api-docs](http://localhost:3000/api-docs)

## API Documentation

Interactive API documentation is available via Swagger. Once the server is running, open your browser and visit:

```
http://localhost:3000/api-docs
```

You can explore all the API endpoints, view details about required parameters, and test them directly from the browser.

## Testing the API

To publish a message using the secure REST API, use Postman or curl.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/messages \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>" \
-d '{"message": "Hello from REST API!"}'
```

Replace `<your_jwt_token>` with a valid JWT token generated using your secret key.
